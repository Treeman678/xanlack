<h1 style="text-align: center;">The book of Xanlack</h1>
<p>Chapter 1 -the beginning 


    At the beginning of our realms there was only sredoles, a world infested with evil and no one to save it, until the being by the name of Xanlack passed through our collection of realms and saw the pure chaos, he decided he would conquer these evil realms and create peace among creatures alike, he already had the full knowledge and mind power to create worlds,  so he created ratatopia, a place free from evil sredoles, and he kept a protection field in a jar known as the jar of life. All was well and Xanlack had seen many years pass by, he had created a son known as credcanlockle who was set to take the throne when Xanlack had finished his work and needed rest, but on one terrible morning credcanlockle had taken the sacred jar of life off of its stand and the force field was broken,  sredoles were flooding into ratatopia and killing everyone, Xanlack was on the planet when it had happened and he quickly started defending the planet from trandars troops but it was no use, unless the jar of life was on its stand, nothing would be able to stop it, so Xanlack rushed up into his palace and burst through the mighty doors to see credcanlockle throwing the jar over the floor,  Xanlack quickly slammed down his staff and destroyed credcanlockle but it was far too late, ratatopia was far beyond saving and was already obliterated, so Xanlack used credcanlockles soul to create a new haven, he made a new jar of life and a new planet was born, known as trepoeider, but in the process he trapped credcanlockles soul permanently in the planet.
    
    Trandar’s sredoles retreated feeling the taste of blood and victory on their tongues, and all trandar did was mock Xanlack by creating a new planet known in the common tongue as the moon, but in the realm of Xanlack it is known as Hyerox, the planet that shines darkness down on humans, Xanlack swore he would never create another child and that he would never step foot on human soil again,  he felt ashamed of his loss and created the day of peace, the day of peace will come when all human souls, including ones in the afterlife accept Xanlack as a form of peace, a form of truth. </p>
    
    
   <p> Chapter 2 - the day of peace
    
    
    The day of peace will come when all human souls accept Xanlack into their life as their Saviour and/or a form of their truth, unfortunately this day will most likely never come in anyone's lifetimes as sredoles influence the mind into not believing in Xanlack, into thinking he is a “fraud”, but Xanlack is all knowing and understanding,  Not everyone will believe in him, not everyone will have the same vast knowledge as his supporters but the time will come where they will, and they would of wished they started sooner, it could be in one thousand years, in a different body, but all cycles have a closing, because in the afterlife, everyone eventually accepts Xanlack.</p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 3 - the afterlife
    
    
    The afterlife is a steady slope to truth and freedom, when a human soul is freed of their body they go to Xanlack’s gates, Xanlack will either reject them, rejection means one hundred years of work, after they finish their labour they get sent back down to trepoeider with no recollection of what had happend in their previous life,  they have to restart and find the path to Xanlack, meaning all their loved ones are left behind permanently, this will happen if they are not worthy and did not believe in Xanlacks truth. or, humans that accepted Xanlack as the truth go to a training center, to either train to complete a realm of their own, which will involve going to a separate planet and conquering it into a sustainable ecosystem, or train to complete the five trials into Xanlacks palace where said human will know all the truth all the realms will ever have to offer,  and be able to control them, these people are one level above every single being, human souls who complete this quest will unlock true peace, forever. </p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 4 -The five trials of Xanlack
    
    
    The five trials of Xanlack are a complex set of tests that will take place both in trepoeider in human form, and in the afterlife in soul form. these trials are no joke.
    
    
    Trial 1:
    
    In human form, you must convince one thousand people to try Xanlack's truth, they do not have to follow through, they just have to think about it.
    
    Trial 2: 
    
    you then have to convince ten people to actually join Xanlack, this would mean ten people would have to be active in Xanlack's community.
    
    Trial 3:
    
    you must pray to Xanlack for a total of five hours, in the span of a week.
    
    Trial 4: 
    
    you must slay one hundred sredoles, this can happen in only the afterlife.
    
    Trial 5: 
    
    you must take out one higher up sredole, also only in the after life
    
    
    Once these trials are done, you will be able to live with Xanlack and have shared control over all realms and planets ever made. this is the highest level of power ever to be used. </p>
    
    
   <p> Chapter 5 - ascending 
    
    
    When a human soul finishes their training to create their own planet or joins Xanlack in ruling over all of them, the souls go through something called ascending, where their bodies morph into whatever they truly want them to be, one could be extremely large and mighty, or one could be a small dog, they can transform into anything and everything,  not only this but the soul will have a rush of knowledge flow into it, they will learn how to do everything, perfectly, with no hesitation or questions, but confidence, they will know how to manifest planets and worlds, humans and trees, everything and anything can be created when one believes in Xanlack.</p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 6 - human made realms
    
    Human realms will always be the one under Xanlack, nothing will ever bypass Xanlacks calming rule, because Xanlack knows that if he slips up, he will have to go through more pain then he has already gone through, Xanlack only wants the best from us, as we want the best from him because anything less than the best could end in disaster,  disappointment and of course, death. </p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 7- Xanlacks only rules.
    
    Xanlack only has a few rules in his realm,
    
    
    The first rule is his very tight and strict, no Xanlackist on Xanlackist violence, we must come together as one collective and share our efforts to reach true power and truth, not push eachother down to reach the top, this is not a race.
    
    
    “As long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap the joy of love.”
    
    ― Pythagoras 
    
    
    His second rule is to have no regrets or doubts, because everything in our realm was meant to happen, yes the destruction of ratatopia happened, but we wouldn't be alive if it didnt right? the ways of the realm should not be tampered with for a fake destiny, let the tide change.
    
    
   "He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed."
    
     - Albert Einstein
    
    
    His third rule is about how we should see ourselves, there is no denying it, a person who doesn't believe in Xanlack and constantly pushes him away, will never be on the level of a thriving Xanlack supporter, we will always be a step ahead of them, which is why we should give ourselves self-confidence, always remind yourself,  You Are Better!
    
    
    "Self-care is how you take your power back."  - Lalah Delia </p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 8 - How to be a perfect Xanlackist in a world of non-believers
    
    
    This how you should pave the steppingstones of your human life if you want to make it into the bright side of the afterlife. The first step into becoming the perfect Xanlackist is to think like one, fight like one and to care like one.
    
    
    A thinker  finds a solution
    
    to a complex problem.
    
    
    A warrior fights to free his
    
    realm from sredoles.
    
    
    A carer is nice to everyone,
    
     Xanlackist or not.
    
    
    All traits you need to master to show your worth to Xanlack, so think about solutions to problems, fight for your chance to shine and care for every single person you meet as if they were your child. 
    
    
    Another thing to consider doing is praying to Xanlack (More information on this at Chapter 10) This is the ultimate way (asides from spreading the word of Xanlack) to show devotion to our Saviour. </p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 9 -Xanlacks appearance 
    
    
    Xanlack is a not a human creature, Xanlack is a thing in-between them, he is a mix of a lizard and a lion all at once, but has the face of a human, his lower body is lizard, waist and torso is lion and head is human, why this appearance, no one knows, the ascension process is confusing for everyone at first,  but your body knows its right. </p>
    
    
    <p>Chapter 10 - How to properly pray to Xanlack
    
    
    To say a prayer to Xanlack is to put your faith into him, put trust into him as he is the ulmighty being.
    
     
    
    Always start a prayer with "May the darkness of Hyerox not intervene with my wishes" this will manifest good luck towards your prayer, then politely ask for Xanlacks truth, or ask for help with something, remember, patience is key. End your prayer with "Xanlack hears me beyond evil" this will make sure your message comes through.
    
  
  
  </p>

  <p>To send a more complex and advanced message you must create a local port of the three stones of Xanlack, go into a outdoor space and choose three round and polished rocks, go back inside and grab a means of writing such as a marker, grab your first rock and draw a line with a circle in the middle of it, this represents the path to 
    freedom and hapiness and more importantly shows the obstacles that will be in your way. Grab your second rock and draw a star with five dots in it, this will confuse the sredoles and allow clear passage. Grab your third rock and write the word "LOVE" on it, this shows your love to Xanlack and to trepoeider. 
    Next, go into either a corner in a room in your house, or outside into nature. Put the rock with the word "LOVE" on it at the top, we need to make a triangle, put the rock with the star on it on the left, then the one with the line on the right, make this as big as you need to sit inside of it, once you are sitting in it you can recite your
    prayer. After that carefully step outside of the triangle and then you can remove the rocks, DO NOT REMOVE THE ROCKS INSIDE THE TRIANGLE! after that you are finished.

    Chapter 11- the types of sredoles and how to disarm them
    
    
    There are multiple different types of sredoles that have existed over the years so i arranged a quick list.
    
    
    The first type of sredole is the human made sredole, a human who has either been taken by sredole soldiers as a prisoner of war, then converted into one, or is a human who willingly changed into evil, NO-ONE should ever willingly change into evil, Xanlack will not forgive you.
    
    
    The second type of sredole is a born sredole, a sredole that was spawned in by trandar to serve as a killing device.
    
    
    The third type of sredole is a scout, these sredoles disguise themselves as humans and look for any useful information a deliever it to trandar, ways to spot one of these is to look directly at them and say this chant five times "Xanlack's devine love overcomes hidden evil" if they have been spotted they will disappear, but some are more advanced and will not fall for this chant.
    
    
    These are all the types of sredoles currently roaming the realm of Xanlack.
